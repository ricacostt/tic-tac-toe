# Tic-Tac-Toe 

## My First Python Project
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using Python. The game is played on the command line interface.

## How to Play
1. Players take turns placing their symbols on a grid. The game is won by getting three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
2. Player X starts the game
3. Enter a row and a column for your move

## Features
- The game keeps track of which player's turn it is.
- It prevents players from overlapping on a tile already taken.
- The game ends when a player wins or it's a tie.
- Currently, you cannot choose your player and you cannot see who wins. These features may be added in the future.

## Run Locally
1. Clone the repo into your local machine
2. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file in your Python environment to play the classic 3x3 game
3. Run the `tic_tac_tow_2.0.py` file in your Python environment to play with a customizable board size grid: just add it as the argument of the function (last line) ex: `play_game(5)` will give you a 5x5 board.
4. Have fun:)
